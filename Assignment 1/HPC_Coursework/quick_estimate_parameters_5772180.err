 This problem is unconstrained.

 Bad direction in the line search;
   refresh the lbfgs memory and restart the iteration.

 Line search cannot locate an adequate point after MAXLS
  function and gradient evaluations.
  Previous x, f and g restored.
 Possible causes: 1 error in function or gradient evaluation;
                  2 rounding error dominate computation.
